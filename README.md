# ISM_Project

This is the project we had done for the course CSE 3502, Information Security Management. 
The major goal of this project is to demonstrate how we can prevent the attackers from getting beyond some of the client-side limits that developers utilise, which can lead to serious web application vulnerabilities. This allows us to assess how safe the website is and how web attacks occur. We will also try to secure cookies using the same method in this project. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, servers can identify users who make requests and provide them access when we utilise cookies.
